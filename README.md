# VisualInertialOdometry

## Introduction

This project is designed for students to learn the front-end and back-end in a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system. The objective is that using feature_tracker in [VINS-MONO](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono) as front-end, and [GTSAM](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam) as back-end to implement a visual inertial odometry (VIO) algorithm for real-data collected by a vehicle: [The MVSEC Dataset](https://daniilidis-group.github.io/mvsec/).

## Instruction
